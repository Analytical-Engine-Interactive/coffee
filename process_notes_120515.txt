a person orders food online
Nick gets an email
Nick quotes the job: he goes into xero and transposes all the items into a quote form
Nick sends the quote to the customer and a calendar event to himself
Nick uses the calendar event to make the food


At new location: wants a system for wifi that is better
can people who are members of the app/of the rewards system get free wifi but others don;t ??

they need a better system for displaying what needs to be made for the day for catering: right now, if they print the orders, it prints in the format they have quotes it (for example 4 half dozen cookies).  this could look like 4 cookies.  need a way to rpint the different “to do’s” in the right format

branded packaging will come in January


Jem to audit different ordering systems
pizza pizza
swiss chalet
starbucks ordering system

get login for website
google analytics??

where is pricing set?  POS?  xero is where all records are kept for all customers and orders.

POS systems: is there a better one than in store?

shopkeep, had more api


need to whiteboard what happens in which system
POS: rewards, customer/members
coffee ordering will have crossover between pos and delivery

for checkout We need to build it so it can take a cheque
anything over $1000 they need a credit card for 20% to hold the order
other than that the user can choose to pay by cheque

need to generate customer emails that are friendly but can’t be changed later than 48 hours to the business day before order is due
so want to give them the capability to change the order from email but that if they click that button within the deadline the page gives them a message saying 

they coffee pub gets an email, Kyle and kitchen, that are easier to read for order prep

stripe is connected to xero

if after the 48 hours the order has not been declined, Nikc will need to go into the system and generate an invoice to be brought with the order

want to have everything in the ctaering kitchen on ipad and printer, so there is an ipad and can print by order or can print out an aggregate production list for the day that says what has tp be done for the day
